# Intergenerational-Family-Support-System
CQ University Brisbane and Brisbane City Council developed IGFSS to connect young families with elderly couples. It enables registration, event displays, and communication, with data securely stored. Each family gets a unique FIDN.  By fostering intergenerational support, IGFSS strengthens community bonds and may expand in the future.
